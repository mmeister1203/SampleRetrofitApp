# Retrofit 2.0 Sample #

* This repo demonstrates how to make GET/POST/DELETE method calls to imgur's api using Retrofit 2.0. The UI for this app is about as simple as it gets since this is mainly demostrating connecting to an API. We start by allowing the user to grab two images from the gallery. Then we create an album using those images. Finally we allow the user to delete the gallery.
* Version: 2.0 - Updates this app to use RxJava/Android and implements clean architecture system.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repo locally
* Open the project in Android Studio
